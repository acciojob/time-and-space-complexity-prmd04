    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity in algorithms refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms are those with lower time complexity, meaning they execute faster for larger inputs.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Space Complexity is often denoted by O(n), where n represents the size of the input. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is crucial for optimizing memory usage in algorithms.</p>
